# Fbonaki - Bharat-Heritage (Heritage & Culture)

## üìù Project Description

Fbonaki's Bharat-Heritage is a pioneering web-based platform that serves as a digital marketplace, designed to celebrate and preserve India's diverse cultural heritage. Our primary goal is to empower and uplift the numerous talented artisans across India by bridging the gap between their craftsmanship and global recognition. üé®

Through this platform, artisans can register and effortlessly showcase their products, supported by instructional videos available in various regional languages. This initiative not only aims to provide visibility for artisans but also ensures that their artistry is preserved and appreciated worldwide.

Our platform provides a holistic approach to promoting cultural heritage. Users can explore and purchase authentic products categorized by state and district, with each item accompanied by QR-coded certificates to guarantee authenticity. By doing so, we aspire to not only connect buyers with unique handmade goods but also to deepen their understanding and appreciation for India's rich cultural traditions.

One of the primary objectives is to expand the reach of these artisanal products globally, contributing significantly to India's economic growth. Moreover, we promote ethical and fair compensation practices, ensuring a sustainable supply chain for all involved.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Declaration in README

This project was primarily conceived and developed during the hackathon. While the foundational front-end template was sourced from an external provider, all core functionalities and key features, such as AR TOUR, VR TOUR, Bharat Heritage E-Commerce platform, blog, and various other aspects, were integrated and developed extensively within the hackathon period.

### Components Integrated:

We acknowledge the use of a pre-existing front-end template sourced from [Template Provider], which laid the groundwork for the project's visual structure and layout. However, during the hackathon, our team focused on enhancing this template by adding distinct components and functionalities to create the comprehensive Bharat-Heritage platform.

### Additional Features Developed:

1. **AR TOUR & VR TOUR Integration:** üåê Leveraging augmented reality and virtual reality, we incorporated immersive experiences to showcase cultural heritage sites and artisanal processes, offering users an engaging and interactive journey.
   
2. **Bharat Heritage E-Commerce Platform:** üíº We integrated an extensive e-commerce system dedicated to artisans, allowing them to exhibit their products and customers to explore, purchase, and support Indian cultural products.
   
3. **Blog and Cultural Content:** üìö Our team developed a rich blog section to provide in-depth cultural insights, stories behind artisan craftsmanship, and articles aiming to deepen users' understanding and appreciation of India's diverse heritage.

4. **Other Enhancements:** ‚ú® Alongside the mentioned features, various other functionalities, user interactions, and design elements were implemented during the hackathon period to make the platform more robust, interactive, and user-friendly.

We want to emphasize that while we utilized an initial template for the project's front-end, the core essence and comprehensive functionalities of the Bharat-Heritage platform were ideated, designed, and developed from scratch within the duration of the hackathon.

Join us in celebrating the spirit of innovation and the incredible journey of creating this platform to empower artisans and promote India's cultural heritage on a global scale! üåèüáÆüá≥ #ArtisansUnite #CulturalEcommerce
